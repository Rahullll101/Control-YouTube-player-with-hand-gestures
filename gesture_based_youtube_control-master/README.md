## Intro
Gesture-based interfaces are systems that allow users to interact with them by using hand or other body components. These applications are getting more and more popular and have a wide range of use cases; for example in [home automation, healthcare, automative, virtual reality](https://emerj.com/ai-sector-overviews/artificial-intelligence-in-gestural-interfaces/), etc. If well designed, gesture-based interfaces feel more natural, intuitive and easier to learn.  

The goal of this project is to use an Artificial Neural Network to recognise a set of hand gestures and use those to interact with a YouTube player. Additionally, if the user is sleeping or has left, the player will get paused automatically.  Here is a [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHVrGI3632s)!!!

Why Youtube player, you might ask? Well, it's popular, there is no need to install a software locally, you can find pretty much any kind of visual content and it's free (as long as you're ok with advertisement :wink:).  
But of course, you can implement the same technique to control a local media player or anything else; just make sure the application allows for keyboard shortcuts or has an API.  




## Approach
### Hand gestures
The approach used for hand gesture detection was highly inspired by [this project](https://github.com/kinivi/tello-gesture-control) from Nikita Kiselov.  One of the advantages of this approach is that, you don't need to collect tons of images to train your model, since you rather use landmarks as model inputs.  
The worklow is as follows:  
* I extracted 2D coordinates from [MediaPipe's hand detector](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/hands.html).  This detector normally outputs 21 3D landmarks; the image below shows all the keypoints.   
In contrast to Nikita, I restricted the points to only wrist and tip coordinates. Wrist coordinates were then subtracted from the rest of the points.   
These new points were then flattened and normalized by the maximum absolute value. Also, I computed the distances between keypoints 4, 8 and 12. Those distances were also normalized by the distance between points 0 and 5.   
It's worth mentioning that only the left hand was considered in this project.

* Both normalized coordinates and distances were then joined together to formed our feature space, then saved, together with the target, for subsequent training. Go [here](#saving-data) to see how to log data.
* Because of the preceding preprocessing steps and the simplicity of the data (13 features and 13 classes of approx. 30 samples each), I trained a [simple artificial neural network](#training).  

The image below depicts the general workflow.

### Sleepness detection
For this feature, I took inspiration from this [Adrian Rosebrock's blog](https://pyimagesearch.com/2017/05/08/drowsiness-detection-opencv/).  The idea is to :
* Detect the face, using the frontal face detector from the Dlib library. This is [how to install Dlib on Ubuntu and macOS](https://pyimagesearch.com/2017/03/27/how-to-install-dlib/) and [here on windows 10](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-dlib-library-for-python-in-windows-10/). 
* Pass the detected face into Dlib shape predictor to output facial landmarks. The pretrained model can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/italojs/facial-landmarks-recognition/blob/master/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat) (95.1 MB).
* From facial landmarks, extract eye landmarks and compute the so-called eye aspect ratio (EAR) to determine when the user is sleeping. User is considered to be sleeping if the EAR drops under a given threshold and stays under that value for at least a predefined number of consecutive frames.  
  
Alternatively, you can use [MediaPipe's face mesh](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/face_mesh.html), extract eye landmarks and compute the EAR. I've found MediaPipe to be more stable and robust (e.g., less sensitive to occlusion). The only problem is that it outputs 468 landmarks, which significantly slowed down the execution of my code. However, if you have a more powerful hardware, you should definitely give it a try. 
### Absence detection
The implementation of this feature was pretty straightforward:
* Detect the presence of a face using [MediaPipe's face detector](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/face_detection.html).
* If a face is not detected for at least a prefined number of consecutives frames, then the user is considered to be absent.  

The general workflow for the sleepness and absence detection looks like this:

## Usage
NB: I'm using Windows 10.
### Installing libraries
I suggest creating a virtual environment and installing the libraries there.
```
cd project_folder_name
python -m venv your_virtual_env_name
your_virtual_env_name\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```
### Saving data
Run `main.py`.  
When the webcam video has loaded, press 'r' on the keyboard to activate the logging mode. By pressing '0' to '9', data get saved in `gestures.csv`; whereby the first column represents the class labels (pressed keys) and the other columns are the normalized keypoints and distances (see example below). To save class labels extending from '10' to potentially '35', you can press alphabet keys (capital letters) from 'A' to 'Z', respectively.  
If you change the number of classes, make sure to correspondingly update the variable `n_classes` in `model_architecture.py` file.

### Training
For training the model, simply run the entire file `train.ipynb`. If you change data, you'll probably need to experiment to obtain an acceptable model's performance. 
In case you change the model architecture, make sure to correspondingly update the `model_architecture.py` file.  The architecture I used looks like this:

### Running the web app
```
cd flask_app
python app.py
```
You'll be provided with a link where the app is running. In the image below, it's running for example at ___http://<span></span>127.0.0.1:5000___.  

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100664869/194744362-67e00d66-0f01-49b2-b253-e4e3bd055003.png">  

Go to that url, copy-paste a youtube video link in the input field and hit the start button.
Both the youtube video and your webcam video will load into the web page.  
Hand gestures are valid only when your hand is in the red box within your webcam video. This is to prevent unintentional interactions with the player (e.g. when scratching your face). You first need to move the mouse above the player and left-click to start the video; of course with hand gestures 😉. This puts the player in focus mode and allows the rest of interactions to be performed.  
It's better to use the 'neutral' gesture between other gestures; this decreases false positive detections that might occur when transitioning directly from one gesture to another.

Here is a list of all the implemented interactions.

## Limitations
* In low light conditions, hand landmark predictions are less stable, which in turn degrades the quality of gesture detection. Same applies to face detectors (mainly Dlib), as the image gets less clear.
* The sleepness detection works well only when your face is frontal to the camera. Dlib's face detector expects a frontal face.
* No detection if you go far away from the web cam.
